# -EcoTrack-2
Scenario:  EcoTrack is advancing its environmental monitoring solutions by introducing a comprehensive system to manage air quality data from multiple sensors. The new system will enhance the ability to track and respond to air quality issues in real-time.

## Assignment:

Develop a RESTful API to handle air quality sensor data. The API should support CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) for sensor data and include secure authentication and authorization. It must be designed to efficiently handle multiple concurrent requests and ensure high data availability.

## Additional Requirements:

API Documentation: Use API documentation tools such as Swagger or OpenAPI to create thorough and clear documentation for the API.
HTTP Methods: Ensure the API supports all standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for all endpoints.
Error Handling: Implement comprehensive error handling to return appropriate HTTP status codes and messages.

# Possible Questions and Answers:

Question: How will you ensure the security of your API?

Answer: We will employ JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication and role-based access control to restrict API operations based on user permissions.
Question: What strategies will you use to maintain the performance of your API?

Answer: To optimize performance, we will utilize data caching strategies, optimize database queries, and implement load balancing to handle high volumes of requests.
Question: How will you test your API to ensure reliability?

Answer: We will implement automated testing using pytest for unit tests and perform integration testing to ensure the API interacts correctly with other components.
Question: Which data format will be used for communication between client and server?

Answer: The API will use JSON format for data exchange due to its ease of use and compatibility with various client-side technologies.
Question: How will you maintain data consistency across parallel operations?

Answer: We will use database transaction mechanisms to ensure data consistency and integrity during concurrent create, update, and delete operations.
Database Schema:

## Tables:

Sensors: Contains details for each sensor, including unique ID, type, model, installation date, and status.
Measurements: Stores air quality measurements such as PM2.5, PM10, CO2 levels, each associated with a specific sensor and timestamped.
Alerts: Logs events that require attention, linked to specific sensors, including descriptions and timestamps.

# Relationships:

The Measurements and Alerts tables will be linked to the Sensors table via foreign keys, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval.
Additional Features:

Real-Time Data Processing: Incorporate WebSocket support for real-time data updates to clients.
Historical Data Analysis: Implement endpoints to retrieve historical data for trend analysis and reporting.
Notification System: Develop a system to send alerts via email or SMS when specific air quality thresholds are breached.
